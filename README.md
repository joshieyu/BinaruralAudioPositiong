# Binaural Audio Positioning

This is an experiment based on concepts explored in the research paper for "BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models." I am attempting a loose recreation of the SpatialAST spatial audio encoder described in the paper which utilizes CNNs and transformers to position binaural sounds in space. This repository contains training data, training scripts, and utility scripts.
